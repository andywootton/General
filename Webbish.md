#Webbish
##Introduction
As someone with a background in Real Programming, long ago, I have found it hard to understand The Web and its ways. 
Talking to others like me who were not deeply immersed in web development as it matured, I have discovered that many are lost or confused by the jargon and the many technologies, some already obsolecent which surround it.

One day, I tried to explain to my son with a diagram what I knew about creating web sites. I discovered that I knew more than I thought and was alarmed at the complexity of what I'd drawn and written. I decided it would be best to record this information before I forgot what it was like not to know the rest. People with excellent local knowledge don't always give the best directions to strangers. They think things are obvious when they aren't. I hope to inform from my position of shrinking ignorance, with the confidence I have gained by learning about other complex technical areas before.
