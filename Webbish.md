#Webbish
##Introduction
As someone with a background in Real Programming, long ago, I've found it hard to learn about The Web and its ways. 
Talking to others like who were not deeply immersed in web development in its formative years, I discovered that many are lost or confused by the jargon and the many technologies, some already obsolecent, which surround it.

One day, I tried to explain to my son, in a diagram, what I knew about creating web sites. I discovered that I knew more than I thought and was alarmed at the complexity of what I'd drawn and written. I decided it would be best to record this information now, before I learned more and forgot what it was like not to know. People with excellent local knowledge don't always give the best directions to strangers because things seem obvious, when they aren't. I hope to inform from a position of shrinking ignorance, relying on the confidence I've gained by learning about other complex technical areas. When I can explain it to others then I'll know that I understand. This relies on you telling me if you discover that anything I've told you is wrong.
