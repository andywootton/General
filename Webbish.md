#Webbish
As someone with a background in Real Programming, long ago, I have found it hard to understand The Web and its ways. 
Talking to others like me who were not deeply immersed in web develpment as it matured, I have discovered that many are lost or confused by the jargon and the many technologies, some already obsolecent which surround it.

One day, I tried to explain to my son what I knew about creating web sites in a diagram. I discovered that I knew more than I thought and decided it would be best to record it before I couldn't remember what it was like not to know more. People with the best local knowledge don't always give the best directions to strangers because they think things are obvious when they aren't. I hope to inform from my position of shrinking ignorance.
