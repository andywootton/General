#Webbish
As someone with a background in Real Programming, long ago, I have found it hard too understand The Web and its ways. 
Talking to others like me who were not deeply immersed in web develpment as it matured, I have discovered that many are lost or confused by the jargon and the many technologies, some already obsolecent which surround it.

One day I sat down tried to explain to my son what I knew in a diagram. I discovered that I knew more than I thought and decided it would be best to record it before I couldn't remember what it was like not to know more. Experts who think that everything is obvious do not always make the best teachers.

There is plenty more I don't know, so I want to start with what I have and try to record as I learn.
