#Webbish
##Introduction
As someone with a background in Real Programming, long ago, I have found it hard to understand The Web and its ways. 
Talking to others like me who were not deeply immersed in web development as it matured, I have discovered that many are lost or confused by the jargon and the many technologies, some already obsolecent which surround it.

One day, I tried to explain to my son what I knew about creating web sites in a diagram. I discovered that I knew more than I thought and was alarmed at the complexity. I decided it would be best to record this information before I couldn't remember what it was like to know so little. People with the best local knowledge don't always give the best directions to strangers. They think things are obvious when they aren't. I hope to inform from my position of shrinking ignorance, with the confidence I have that comes from knowing I've learned about other complex technical areas before.
